## 大好！

We're always trying to improve our flow and structure, which for a long time now has involved a basic HTML site that didn't have very much functionality and was always in need of improvement.

In order to make the site easier to manage, broadcast messages more widely, and to have a more professional appearance, we've got a new web presence for the new semester!

All future announcements will come out here, but as of yet, these announcements don't include the verdict on whether or not we're recognized on CampusGroups. 謝謝你們都有耐心，我希望能快快地來告訴你一些好消息。

As always, if you have any suggestions about the club's function, activities, or the site, you can make them on the guestbook page linked at "Suggestions".

一月見！
