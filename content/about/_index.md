The Chinese Conversation Table is open to anyone, with any level of Mandarin experience!

From new learners to native speakers, the Chinese Conversation Table is a place to get together, practice language skills, share information, and have discussions in Mandarin and about topics in the greater Chinese-speaking world.

In fall of 2024, we met every Saturday from 12PM-1PM. For more information, we're always on the Discord server linked at the top of the page.

You can also follow the blog on this site, and then every week, we'll make a post with exactly when, where, and what we'll be meeting for.

We sometimes play board games, sometimes give presentations, sometimes, we don't really have a plan and just talk â€” if you have suggestions, be sure to leave them in the guestbook in the "suggestions" tab!
