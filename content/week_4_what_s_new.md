歡迎來2月!

While we're still waiting to be able to make a few changes to our scheduling, location, and advertisement — we have a new poster that we'll start hanging on boards around campus once we're (hopefully) officialized — at the moment, we're still in WAL 4510 from 4-5PM.

As far as activities go, we still have board and card games, and any that you might have and want to bring are welcome too — especially video games, like Jackbox games, which might be a little bit more fun & engaging than the separate group activities that we've tried before. Last week's Google Slides presentation practice was interesting, but trying the same idea with Talking Points from Jackbox Party Pack 7 might be even better. If you have a copy of that game and want to bring it, you definitely can — if not, we'll probably have to invest the thirty dollars sometime soon, because this seems like a good idea.

We've also got decorations and some food to bring to meetings now to liven the mood a little bit — the room's felt a little bit bare these past few weeks. I've got a table runner and a little basket to put White Rabbit in. I hear that we might also have pineapple cakes.

Another thing that's important to mention (and is also waiting on our pending recognition) is e-board selection for the fall. The positions that we need to fill are president, secretary, and treasurer, and at the moment our five-person group is mostly driving on enthusiasm & vision (if you're good at Mandarin — unlike me — and want to see the club succeed, please consider running for e-board! It's not that hard — we don't do that much — just make flyers and send out announcements every once in a while!). We'll start assembling a ballot and put out a poll sometime before the end of the semester, but this is a long-term goal at the moment to be accomplished before the end of the semester.

If you haven't already, we have some forms up on the site here — one at the "suggestions" tab above — including a When2Meet, which you can find [here](https://www.when2meet.com/?28725888-ovfHz). If you want to decide when our new time will be, make sure to fill it out!

非常感謝，大家！

明天見！
