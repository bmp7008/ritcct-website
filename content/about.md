The Chinese Conversation Table is a student group for getting together, practicing language skills and vocabulary, sharing information, and discussing topics about the greater Chinese-speaking world.

Right now, we meet between 4 PM and 5 PM every Friday in WAL 4510. For more information, join the Discord server linked in the navbar.

On our site you can find announcements and our calendar. Each week, we broadcast the time, place, and plans for our upcoming meeting.

If you have any suggestions, just show up with them or fill out the suggestions form — new ideas are always welcome. Thank you for your interest!

谢谢你看一看！
