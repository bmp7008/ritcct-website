Hi again!

As of this week, meeting notifications will be sent on Mondays instead of at the end of the week, and we'll have plans ready further in advance.

<!--more-->

This week, there will be:

 - Board games at the MLC student lounge, 6:30 PM on Wednesday (Feb 26)
 - Poker/card games at WAL 4510, 4:00 PM on Friday (Feb 28)

You can view our calendar at [this link](https://pastecal.com/8P47KLUH?view=month). If you have any ideas, we'll totally add them in advance. We're trying to keep everything planned a month ahead.

祝好！
