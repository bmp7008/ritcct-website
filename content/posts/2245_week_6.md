你們好！

This week's meeting will happen as usual from 4-5 PM in WAL 4510.

<!--more-->

In addition to the announcements for tomorrow's meeting, we also have a few new things to talk about — first, we have a new suggestions form [here](https://forms.gle/CgzHqhARVd1Xv9SR9) where you can suggest things for us to do next meeting if you have any ideas.

We don't have any suggestions as of yet, so we can try Jackbox Talking Points again (or maybe another one of those games), or maybe Mafia/the group circle game where you have to find the killer (we did that once last semester and it was pretty fun).

Next, we've also got a new second meeting happening weekly in the MLC student lounge — on the third floor of Eastman — which will begin next week on Wednesday. These meetings will be mostly just group discussion, board games or studying, and other things that we can fit on one table (the MLC lounge is a little bit smaller than our usual meeting place).

We have a new calendar that you can use to track when we hold events (this will have all of the regularly scheduled weekly meetings as well as other events that we might decide to hold). The link is [here](https://pastecal.com/8P47KLUH?date=2025-02-15&view=month).

See you all tomorrow!
