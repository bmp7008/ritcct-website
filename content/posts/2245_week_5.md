This week, we're going to continue to do the same kinds of conversation practice and group activities that we've been running for the past few weeks. We'll be in the same place at the same time (WAL 4510 from 4 PM to 5 PM).

We've run the second When2Meet for this semester for a little while, now, and it looks like we're not going to be able to find a single time that works for everyone. So, as of next week, we're going to start meeting twice a week — once during the normal meeting time, and then a second group study session at 6:30 on Wednesdays. We still don't have room-booking capacity, so for choosing a place, we should pick somewhere public — like RITz or the first floor of the library. You can vote for a location [here](https://forms.gle/Mu4xpis79CQLYLf86).

Finally, we're going to start instituting a mailing list based on the attendance form that we put up on the board during the normal Friday meetings. If you filled out the form at the last meeting, you should be getting this notification via email, and in the next attendance form there will be an opt-in checkbox so that you can confirm whether or not you would like to continue to receive these messages.

We should also start sending these out sooner and with more information once we start formulating more detailed plans for future meetings and event ideas.

希望明天见！
