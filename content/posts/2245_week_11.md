This week, we'll have the meeting to set up our CampusGroups page and a few other things, so you'll have other places to go for future club information shortly. The old website will come down when this happens, and ritcct.com will redirect to the CampusGroups page.

We have the same two meetings as usual at 6:30 PM in the MLC student lounge on Wednesday and at 4:00 PM at WAL 4510 on Friday.

Seeing that we only have a month to hold any potential e-board elections, a form is now also linked right here --> (https://forms.gle/wh2rFVWVroiDLCub9) for you to access to submit your name and a role if you're interested. The President/Vice President role is considered one, and whoever is the runner-up for President will become VP.

General role responsibilities include â€”

President/VP: Oversight, attendance at club meetings. Oversees event planning and the roles of other e-board members, including finances and appointment of the Language Advisor.

Treasurer: Oversees club finances, conducts fundraising, and keeps financial records.

Secretary: Keeps attendance lists at club meetings and writes weekly announcement posts describing recent updates and future plans.

Thanks to everyone for the support!
