Hi everyone!

Now that spring break is over, we're back with two more meetings this week — one on Wednesday from 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM in the MLC student lounge, and one from 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM in WAL 4510 on Friday.

<!--more-->

On Wednesday, we'll just have more discussions about anything anyone wants to talk about (but in Mandarin), and then on Friday, we might continue last meeting's rounds of 升級. We could also try something else if anyone's interested.

Hope to see you back! If you haven't been to a Wednesday meeting before and you want to, they're new — you should come!

拜拜！
