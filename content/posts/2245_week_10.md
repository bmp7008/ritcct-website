We're officially pre-approved for club status now, which means that we should be officially and fully recognized as a student organization by next semester.

Besides this, we have the usual two meetings at 6:30 PM in the MLC student lounge on Wednesday and at 4:00 PM in WAL 4510 on Friday.

Continuing about e-board roles — since we're now going to be recognized and not every e-board member here now will be here in the fall, we need to elect new e-board positions soon for the upcoming semester.

So far, the e-board has five roles: President & Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Language Advisor. The current structure seems to be that President & VP run together, Secretary & Treasurer are elected separately, and then the four-person e-board will appoint a Language Advisor based on club membership later in the semester. If any one of you wants one of these roles, you should totally run! We need candidates!

The election will probably be during our last meeting at the end of April. Even if you aren't interested in a role right now, please consider one — they aren't too much responsibility — they require a few training quizzes to be done on CampusGroups, but after that (so far, anyway) club management has been not too difficult.

Hope to see you Wednesday/Friday!
