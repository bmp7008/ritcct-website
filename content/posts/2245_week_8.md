晚安！

This week, we'll have two meetings again — one in the MLC student lounge on the third floor of Eastman on Wednesday beginning at 6:30 PM, and one in WAL 4510 on Friday from 4 to 5 PM.

The Wednesday meeting is just a conversation table for discussion, and on Friday we'll continue with card games like we had last week.

See you all then!

那後，春假快樂！
