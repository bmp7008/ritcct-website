	  <p><i>The Chinese Conversation Table is open to anyone, with any level of Mandarin experience!</i></p>
	  <p>From new learners to native speakers, the Chinese Conversation Table is a place to get together, practice language skills, share information, and have discussions in Mandarin and about topics in the greater Chinese-speaking world.</p>
	  <p>We meet every Saturday from 12PM-1PM. For more information, we're always on the Discord server linked above — you can also join the mailing list, and then every week, we'll send out an email telling you exactly when, where, and what we'll be meeting for this week.</p>
	  <p>We sometimes play board games, sometimes give presentations, sometimes, we don't really have a plan and just talk — if you have suggestions, be sure to leave them in the guestbook in the "suggestions" tab!</p>
	  <p>You can manage your mailing list membership using the form below.</p>
