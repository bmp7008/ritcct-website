There isn&rsquo;t much new information to add for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting because we planned it out last week — we&rsquo;re still going to bring board games, and we&rsquo;ll be meeting in WAL 4510 on Friday, January 24, from 4:00–5:00PM.
We&rsquo;re going to have Chinese chess (象棋) and Catan, probably at least a few decks of cards, and whichever other board games anyone attending might have and want to bring.
It is looking, though, like as we try to build the club and gain membership, we&rsquo;re running into scheduling troubles — right now, on the When2Meet for this semester (which is still open, linked on the &ldquo;About&rdquo; tab, if you would like to change your response or fill it out if you haven&rsquo;t already), there isn&rsquo;t one single time that everyone is available, so we&rsquo;ve been discussing introducing some ways that we can have asynchronous club engagement in addition to the in-person meetings.">

<p>As of now, ideas include a Minecraft server &amp; some more regularly-scheduled voice chatting on the Discord — as of now, it seems like the only two voice channels we have go mostly unused. We can definitely add more features/roles/channels to the Discord server as we gain membership in order to make it a better off-hours meeting environment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need to begin working on a system for polling to decide a lot of these questions (most likely Google Forms on this site), so check back to the announcements page soon for more information on what we&rsquo;re planning on coordinating for future plans and projects.</p>
<p>明天見！</p>
