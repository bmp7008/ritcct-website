While we&rsquo;re still waiting to be able to make a few changes to our scheduling, location, and advertisement — we have a new poster that we&rsquo;ll start hanging on boards around campus once we&rsquo;re (hopefully) officialized — at the moment, we&rsquo;re still in WAL 4510 from 4-5PM.
As far as activities go, we still have board and card games, and any that you might have and want to bring are welcome too — especially video games, like Jackbox games, which might be a little bit more fun &amp; engaging than the separate group activities that we&rsquo;ve tried before. Last week&rsquo;s Google Slides presentation practice was interesting, but trying the same idea with Talking Points from Jackbox Party Pack 7 might be even better. If you have a copy of that game and want to bring it, you definitely can — if not, we&rsquo;ll probably have to invest the thirty dollars sometime soon, because this seems like a good idea.">

      <p>歡迎來2月!</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re still waiting to be able to make a few changes to our scheduling, location, and advertisement — we have a new poster that we&rsquo;ll start hanging on boards around campus once we&rsquo;re (hopefully) officialized — at the moment, we&rsquo;re still in WAL 4510 from 4-5PM.</p>
<p>As far as activities go, we still have board and card games, and any that you might have and want to bring are welcome too — especially video games, like Jackbox games, which might be a little bit more fun &amp; engaging than the separate group activities that we&rsquo;ve tried before. Last week&rsquo;s Google Slides presentation practice was interesting, but trying the same idea with Talking Points from Jackbox Party Pack 7 might be even better. If you have a copy of that game and want to bring it, you definitely can — if not, we&rsquo;ll probably have to invest the thirty dollars sometime soon, because this seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got decorations and some food to bring to meetings now to liven the mood a little bit — the room&rsquo;s felt a little bit bare these past few weeks. I&rsquo;ve got a table runner and a little basket to put White Rabbit in. I hear that we might also have pineapple cakes.</p>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s important to mention (and is also waiting on our pending recognition) is e-board selection for the fall. The positions that we need to fill are president, secretary, and treasurer, and at the moment our five-person group is mostly driving on enthusiasm &amp; vision (if you&rsquo;re good at Mandarin — unlike me — and want to see the club succeed, please consider running for e-board! It&rsquo;s not that hard — we don&rsquo;t do that much — just make flyers and send out announcements every once in a while!). We&rsquo;ll start assembling a ballot and put out a poll sometime before the end of the semester, but this is a long-term goal at the moment to be accomplished before the end of the semester.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, we have some forms up on the site here — one at the &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; tab above — including a When2Meet, which you can find <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?28725888-ovfHz">here</a>. If you want to decide when our new time will be, make sure to fill it out!</p>
<p>非常感謝，大家！</p>
<p>明天見！</p>
