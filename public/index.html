<p>This week&rsquo;s meeting will run similarly to last week&rsquo;s, because a lot of people are probably going to go to the New Year&rsquo;s celebration events happening around campus — if you want to show up, we&rsquo;ll be in WAL 4510 again from 4:00-5:00PM. Since we might have a smaller group, we&rsquo;ll try to think of activities that can get us all doing the same thing (i.e. one-minute introductions).</p>
<p>One idea that could be fun is giving everybody 15 minutes to create a presentation full of random pictures (put in whatever you want, as long as there are no words and it&rsquo;s a reasonable length) and then trading presentations between people and having them improvise and give the presentation (in Mandarin, of course). If we have enough agreement that this is a good idea, we might try that this Friday (and if it&rsquo;s successful, we&rsquo;ll definitely do it again later).</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much new information to add for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting because we planned it out last week — we&rsquo;re still going to bring board games, and we&rsquo;ll be meeting in WAL 4510 on Friday, January 24, from 4:00–5:00PM.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have Chinese chess (象棋) and Catan, probably at least a few decks of cards, and whichever other board games anyone attending might have and want to bring.</p>
<p>It is looking, though, like as we try to build the club and gain membership, we&rsquo;re running into scheduling troubles — right now, on the When2Meet for this semester (which is still open, linked on the &ldquo;About&rdquo; tab, if you would like to change your response or fill it out if you haven&rsquo;t already), there isn&rsquo;t one single time that everyone is available, so we&rsquo;ve been discussing introducing some ways that we can have asynchronous club engagement in addition to the in-person meetings.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new semester! It&rsquo;s been awhile — if you were on the mailing list, you should&rsquo;ve received an email to let you know that from now on, updates will be made on this web site. If anyone you know is interested, point them here!</p>
<p>First, the When2Meet from last semester has been gathering potential time slots, and we&rsquo;re converging on Fridays, from 4:00-5:00PM. We&rsquo;ve booked the rooms as of today, and this is WAL 4510 for all meetings this semester.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re always trying to improve our flow and structure, which for a long time now has involved a basic HTML site that didn&rsquo;t have very much functionality and was always in need of improvement.</p>
<p>In order to make the site easier to manage, broadcast messages more widely, and to have a more professional appearance, we&rsquo;ve got a new web presence for the new semester!</p>
<p>All future announcements will come out here, but as of yet, these announcements don&rsquo;t include the verdict on whether or not we&rsquo;re recognized on CampusGroups. 謝謝你們都有耐心，我希望能快快地來告訴你一些好消息。</p>
