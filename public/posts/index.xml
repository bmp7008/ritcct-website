      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we&amp;rsquo;ll have the meeting to set up our CampusGroups page and a few other things, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have other places to go for future club information shortly. The old website will come down when this happens, and ritcct.com will redirect to the CampusGroups page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have the same two meetings as usual at 6:30 PM in the MLC student lounge on Wednesday and at 4:00 PM at WAL 4510 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re officially pre-approved for club status now, which means that we should be officially and fully recognized as a student organization by next semester.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides this, we have the usual two meetings at 6:30 PM in the MLC student lounge on Wednesday and at 4:00 PM in WAL 4510 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that spring break is over, we&amp;rsquo;re back with two more meetings this week — one on Wednesday from 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM in the MLC student lounge, and one from 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM in WAL 4510 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi again!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of this week, meeting notifications will be sent on Mondays instead of at the end of the week, and we&amp;rsquo;ll have plans ready further in advance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we&amp;rsquo;re going to continue to do the same kinds of conversation practice and group activities that we&amp;rsquo;ve been running for the past few weeks. We&amp;rsquo;ll be in the same place at the same time (WAL 4510 from 4 PM to 5 PM).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re still waiting to be able to make a few changes to our scheduling, location, and advertisement — we have a new poster that we&amp;rsquo;ll start hanging on boards around campus once we&amp;rsquo;re (hopefully) officialized — at the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re still in WAL 4510 from 4-5PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s meeting will run similarly to last week&amp;rsquo;s, because a lot of people are probably going to go to the New Year&amp;rsquo;s celebration events happening around campus — if you want to show up, we&amp;rsquo;ll be in WAL 4510 again from 4:00-5:00PM. Since we might have a smaller group, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to think of activities that can get us all doing the same thing (i.e. one-minute introductions).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much new information to add for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s meeting because we planned it out last week — we&amp;rsquo;re still going to bring board games, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be meeting in WAL 4510 on Friday, January 24, from 4:00–5:00PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new semester! It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile — if you were on the mailing list, you should&amp;rsquo;ve received an email to let you know that from now on, updates will be made on this web site. If anyone you know is interested, point them here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
