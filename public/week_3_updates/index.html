This week&rsquo;s meeting will run similarly to last week&rsquo;s, because a lot of people are probably going to go to the New Year&rsquo;s celebration events happening around campus — if you want to show up, we&rsquo;ll be in WAL 4510 again from 4:00-5:00PM. Since we might have a smaller group, we&rsquo;ll try to think of activities that can get us all doing the same thing (i.e. one-minute introductions).
One idea that could be fun is giving everybody 15 minutes to create a presentation full of random pictures (put in whatever you want, as long as there are no words and it&rsquo;s a reasonable length) and then trading presentations between people and having them improvise and give the presentation (in Mandarin, of course). If we have enough agreement that this is a good idea, we might try that this Friday (and if it&rsquo;s successful, we&rsquo;ll definitely do it again later).">

<p>This week&rsquo;s meeting will run similarly to last week&rsquo;s, because a lot of people are probably going to go to the New Year&rsquo;s celebration events happening around campus — if you want to show up, we&rsquo;ll be in WAL 4510 again from 4:00-5:00PM. Since we might have a smaller group, we&rsquo;ll try to think of activities that can get us all doing the same thing (i.e. one-minute introductions).</p>
<p>One idea that could be fun is giving everybody 15 minutes to create a presentation full of random pictures (put in whatever you want, as long as there are no words and it&rsquo;s a reasonable length) and then trading presentations between people and having them improvise and give the presentation (in Mandarin, of course). If we have enough agreement that this is a good idea, we might try that this Friday (and if it&rsquo;s successful, we&rsquo;ll definitely do it again later).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re (hopefully) close to recognition as a real student organization. The relevant people meet today to decide our fate, and if the news is good, you&rsquo;ll definitely hear about it! After this, we&rsquo;ll have to put together a CampusGroups presence and put together resources for advertising ourselves (better flyers in designated posting areas around campus, presences at club fairs, and whatever else we can do).</p>
<p>Once we have our own club recognition, too, we&rsquo;ll be able to have more freedom in booking rooms to the schedules of people who&rsquo;d like to show up to meetings. We already have our 4:00-5:00PM room &amp; time set for the near future, but we have a new When2Meet (at <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?28725888-ovfHz">this link</a>) that we&rsquo;ll use to decide if we should try to work to change meeting times later on. If you want to show up, please make sure to fill this out soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in — wishing you all a fantastic second day of the year of the wood snake.</p>
<p>再见！</p>
