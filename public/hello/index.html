We&rsquo;re always trying to improve our flow and structure, which for a long time now has involved a basic HTML site that didn&rsquo;t have very much functionality and was always in need of improvement.
In order to make the site easier to manage, broadcast messages more widely, and to have a more professional appearance, we&rsquo;ve got a new web presence for the new semester!
All future announcements will come out here, but as of yet, these announcements don&rsquo;t include the verdict on whether or not we&rsquo;re recognized on CampusGroups. 謝謝你們都有耐心，我希望能快快地來告訴你一些好消息。">
